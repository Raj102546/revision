    <p>This burger is seared three times to create a crispy crust and juicy interior. The whiskey adds a unique flavor that pairs perfectly with the beef.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef (80% lean)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup whiskey</li>
        <li>4 slices cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns, toasted</li>
        <li>Lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and condiments of choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Divide the ground beef into four equal portions and shape each portion into a patty. Season both sides of each patty with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Add the olive oil to the hot skillet. Place the patties in the skillet and sear for 2-3 minutes on each side until a crust forms. Remove the patties from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the whiskey to the skillet, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Let it cook for about 1 minute to reduce slightly.</li>
        <li>Return the patties to the skillet and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness. During the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheddar cheese on each patty to melt.</li>
        <li>Remove the patties from the skillet and let them rest for a few minutes. Assemble the burgers by placing each patty on a toasted bun and adding lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and your favorite condiments.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately and enjoy your Triple Seared Whiskey Burger!</li>
